# Ecommerce Backend

## Description
### What is this?
A simple backend system for an ecommerce business that performs CRUD operations on a MySQL database â€” to help you store, organize, and establish relationships between an ecommerce store's products, their categories, and product tags.

### How does it work?
This Ecommerce Backend uses a Sequelize to model tables and operate on a MySQL relational database. Routing is done using Express.js, following RESTful practices.

## Installation and Usage
1. Install the necessary dependencies: Node.js, MySQL.
2. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
3. Use `npm install` to get the required packages.
4. Set up your environment variables and database connection.
5. Create the database by sourcing schema located in the `db` directory.
6. Run `npm run seed` to create the required tables and seed them with (development) data.
7. Run `npm run start` to start the server.
8. Use your preferred HTTP client to perform GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations on the data. 
   1. GET: Get a list of all categories
   2. GET: Get a category
   3. POST: Add a new category
   4. PUT: Update a category's name
